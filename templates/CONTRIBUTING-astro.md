# Contributing to {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Thanks for your interest in contributing to {{PROJECT_NAME}}! This guide covers how to get set up and what we expect from pull requests.

## Objectives

{{OBJECTIVES}}

## Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CascadingLabs/{{REPO_NAME}}.git
cd {{REPO_NAME}}
bun install
```

**Prerequisites:**

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | >= 24 (LTS) | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Bun | >= 1.3.11 | [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) |

> **Why Node.js?** Astro's build toolchain requires Node.js internally even when Bun is the package manager and script runner. The system Node must meet Astro's minimum version requirement.

### Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
uvx prek install
```

[Prek](https://github.com/thesuperzapper/prek) is a Rust-based pre-commit runner that executes git hooks automatically on every `git commit`, catching issues before they reach CI. It reads the same `.pre-commit-config.yaml` format. In this repo the hooks run Biome (lint + format), check for secrets via gitleaks, and enforce conventional commit messages via commitizen. To run all hooks manually:

```bash
uvx prek run --all-files
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build

```bash
bun run build
```

## Linting & Formatting

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting. The config lives in `biome.json`.

**Key rules:**

- Tab indentation, 80-char line width
- Single quotes, trailing commas, semicolons
- No unused imports (error), no unused variables (warn)
- Sorted Tailwind classes enforced via `useSortedClasses`
- Some rules relaxed for `.astro` files (see `biome.json` overrides)

### Commands

```bash
# Lint
bun run lint

# Format
bun run format

# Lint + format (auto-fix)
bun run check
```

CI runs `biome check` on every push and PR. Your PR must pass this check.

## Issues

We use [GitHub issue forms](https://github.com/CascadingLabs/{{REPO_NAME}}/issues/new/choose) for all issues. Pick the template that fits:

- **Bug Report** -something is broken or behaving unexpectedly.
- **Feature Request** -suggest a new feature or improvement.
- **Question** -ask a question about usage or internals.
- **Ticket** -internal planning ticket for tracked work.

Blank issues are disabled -please use a template so we have the context we need to help.

## Pull Request Rules

1. **Branch from `main`** -create a feature branch (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`).
2. **Keep PRs focused** -one logical change per PR.
3. **Pass CI** -Biome check and build must succeed.
4. **Use the PR template** -every PR auto-fills a template. Fill in all sections:
   - **Intent** -what the PR does and why.
   - **Changes** -a summary of what was changed.
   - **GenAI usage** -check the box and describe how AI was used, if applicable. All AI-generated code must be reviewed line-by-line.
   - **Risks** -any risks or side effects this PR might introduce.
5. **Link an issue** -reference the issue your PR addresses with `Closes #<number>`.

### Commit Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new component
fix: correct layout issue on mobile
docs: update README with deployment steps
```
